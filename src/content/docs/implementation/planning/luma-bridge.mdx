## Side-by-side Implementation / Luma Bridge

* What is side-by-side or Luma bridge?
  * Luma bridge is an implementation for Edge Delivery + Commerce storefront projects where the complex transactional part of the store (cart, checkout, account) is re-used instead of being rebuilt during the project.
  * If the previous discovery steps led to the conclusion that dropins can be used for cart, checkout and account experiences, Luma Bridge is not needed or can be reduced to parts that are not covered by dropins (e.g. heavy customizations).
  * If existing headless implementatiosn for cart, checkout, account (e.g. [PWA Studio](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio), [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/)) are available, Luma Bridge is not needed.
  * Rebuilding cart, checkout or account pages as part of the project is usually not feasible.
  * Instead: Re-use existing cart, checkout and account pages based on Luma PHP. You can use Luma Bridge to route the shopper to the PHP-based cart, checkout and account pages.
  * Be aware that with a side-by-side / Luma Bridge implementation, you will not achieve a 100 Lighthouse score on cart, checkout and account pages.

* Clarify the architecture of the cart, checkout and account part before the start of the project.

* When using Luma Bridge, please ensure you have engineers on the project with backend PHP knowledge on Adobe Commerce.
