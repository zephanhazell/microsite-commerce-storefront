Compared to content blocks, blocks that enable Adobe Commerce functionality (minicart, product teaser, recommendations) can become quite complex.

Using a frontend framework can help manage the complexity. In the boilerplate, you can find examples of blocks that use a buildless version of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm).

You should only use it for blocks that require complex state management with different render states. Otherwise, stick with plain JavaScript.

Use the existing blocks in the Commerce boilerplate as a reference (e.g. teaser and product recommendations).

If you want to use React, this is possible, but not recommended. React is usually too heavy (size + execution) to achieve perfect lighthouse scores.
