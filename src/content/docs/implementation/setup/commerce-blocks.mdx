## Implement Commerce blocks

* Compared to content blocks, blocks that enable Commerce functionality (e.g. minicart, product teaser, recommendations) can become quite complex.

* Usage of a frontend framework can help with managing the complexity.
  * In the boilerplate you can find examples of blocks that use a [buildless](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route) version of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm).
  * Only use it for blocks that require complex state management with different render states. Otherwise stick with plain JavaScript.
  * Use existing blocks in Commerce boilerplate as reference (e.g. teaser and product recommendations).

* If you want to use React, this is possible, but not recommended. React is usually too heavy (size + execution) to achieve perfect lighthouse scores.
