title: Dropins and widgets
description: Add dropins and widgets to your Adobe Commerce storefront on Edge Delivery Services project.
---

Depending on the outcome of the discovery phase, you can add dropins and widgets to the project.

You can find the integration patterns for dropins and widgets as pull requests in the [Edge Delivery + Commerce repository](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce).

The PLP/Search and autocomplete widgets can be fully customized. Feel free to create project specific forks.
  * https://github.com/adobe/storefront-product-listing-page
  * The boilerplate uses the following fork with more optimizations: https://github.com/herzog31/storefront-product-listing-page
      * https://github.com/adobe/storefront-search-as-you-type
      * Please consider open PRs which might contain unmerged improvements for Edge Delivery Services.

* The source code of dropins is private. You can add them to your project as NPM packages:
  * `@dropins/storefront-cart`
  * `@dropins/storefront-checkout`
  * `@dropins/storefront-auth`
  * `@dropins/storefront-order-confirmation`
  * `@dropins/storefront-pdp`
  * `@dropins/tools`
  
  :::note
  Adobe recommends using the documented [extension](/dropins/all/extending/) patterns for dropins.

If dropins and widgets cannot be used, use the custom PDP and PLP/Search blocks that come with the Edge Delivery + Commerce boilerplate.

## URL format of catalog pages

By default the boilerplate uses [folder mapping](https://www.aem.live/developer/folder-mapping) for product detail pages (PDP) and dedicated pages for product list pages (PLP). If your catalog has a large amount of PLPs, it might make sense to use folder mapping also for PLPs. While a low number of PDPs or PLPs could justify creating dedicated pages for each.

The URL format for folder mapped PDPs looks like this:

```plaintext
/products/{urlKey}/{sku}
```

This is to include the SEO relevant `urlKey` parameter and the `SKU` which is needed to perform Catalog Service queries. Feel free to customize the format as needed. Advanced customization might have to be done on the CDN.

:::note[Uppcase characters in URLs]
Be aware that Edge Delivery Services does not handle URLs with uppercase letters well. This can cause issues if any of your product SKUs contain uppercase characters.
  * URLs generated by Edge Delivery Service will always be lowercase.
  * Product detail page URLs with uppercase letters will still work.
