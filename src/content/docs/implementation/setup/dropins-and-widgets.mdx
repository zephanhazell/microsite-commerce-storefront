## Add Commerce dropins / widgets

* Depending on the outcome of the discovery phase, you can add dropins and widgets to the project.
* You can find the integration patterns for dropins and widgets as pull requests in the [Edge Delivery + Commerce repository](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce).
  * The PLP/Search and autocomplete widgets can be fully customized. Feel free to create project specific forks.
    * https://github.com/adobe/storefront-product-listing-page
    * Boilerplate uses the following fork with more optimizations: https://github.com/herzog31/storefront-product-listing-page
      * https://github.com/adobe/storefront-search-as-you-type
      * Please consider open PRs which might contain unmerged improvements for Edge Delivery.

* The source code of dropins is internal. You can add them to your project as npm packages.
  * `@dropins/storefront-cart`
  * `@dropins/storefront-checkout`
  * `@dropins/storefront-auth`
  * `@dropins/storefront-order-confirmation`
  * `@dropins/storefront-pdp`
  * `@dropins/tools`
  * It is recommended to use the documented extension patterns for the dropins. You can find the documentation at https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/product-details/pdp-introduction/.

* If dropins and widgets cannot be used, please use the custom PDP and PLP/Search blocks that come with the Edge Delivery + Commerce boilerplate.

* URL format of catalog pages

  * By default the boilerplate uses [folder mapping](https://www.aem.live/developer/folder-mapping) for product detail pages (PDP) and dedicated pages for product list pages (PLP).
  * If the customer catalog has a large amount of PLPs, it might make sense to use folder mapping also for PLPs. While a low number of PDPs or PLPs could justify creating dedicated pages for each.
  * The URL format for folder mapped PDPs looks like this: `/products/{urlKey}/{sku}`. This is to include the SEO relevant urlKey parameter and the SKU which is needed to perform Catalog Service queries. Feel free to customize the format as needed. Advanced customization might have to be done on CDN.
  * Be aware that Edge Delivery does not like URLs with uppercase letters which might cause issues when customers using uppercase characters in SKUs.
    * URLs generated by Edge Delivery (e.g. index) will always be fully lowercase.
    * Product detail page URLs with uppercase letters will however fully work.
