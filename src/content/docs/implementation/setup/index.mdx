This section highlights the differences during the implementation phase compared to normal Edge Delivery projects.

Adobe recommends starting with the [Commerce boilerplate](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce) to get a head start on the implementation. The [Ceate your storefront tutorial](/get-started/) provides all the information that you need to get started in about 20 minutes. 

The boilerplate GitHub repsitory is a fork of the [Edge Delivery Services boilerplate](https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate). It includes additional code specifically for Commerce use cases.

:::note[Note]
All of the implementation guidance on this site is based on the Commerce boilerplate.
