## Go-live checklist

* Please track tasks that have to be performed as part of the go-live. During the development phase of your project you will encounter tasks around migrating implementations that were done on a development or staging environment to production. It is essential to keep track of these changes, to make them reproducible on the production environment as part of the go-live activities.

* We discourage scheduling a go-live shortly before the weekend, as the Adobe engineering team might have limited availability fix critical issues if they occur.

* Please start your list with https://www.aem.live/docs/go-live-checklist. For Commerce sites, please put an increased priority on SEO topics.

* Additionally, please also consider the following action items.
    * Switch to Catalog Service production endpoint (https://catalog-service.adobe.io/graphql)
      * Ensure a production environment is configured in Service Connector (will result in a new environmentId).
      * Sync production catalog to the new production environment.
      * Create a new Commerce production API key pair and use public key as x-api-key value.
      * Double check category IDs and make sure all category pages have a reference to the correct category.
      * Update environmentId and x-api-key values in .helix/config.xlsx.
      * Let the Catalog Service team know about the new production environment and go-live date.
    * Use production GraphQL endpoint yourproject.com/graphql. Needs to be changed in CDN.
      * Make sure to also use this for all the Sidekick extensions and scripts (e.g. sitemap generation, image importer).
    * When using Adobe Commerce Fastly, request a new CDN purge token for Commerce production environment.
      * Update in Sharepoint in .helix/config.xlsx file (authToken and serviceId). 
    * Verify / Update links for password reset e-mail to match EDS implementation in Commerce admin.
    * Verify configuration of integrations and payment providers (e.g. reCAPTCHA, Adyen, Bazaarvoice).
      * Provide and configure production keys.
      * Verify that the new domains / subdomains are allowlisted and potential backend webhooks are working.
    * Add robots.txt
      * Block /drafts path on CDN to prevent any drafts to be publicly accessible on the production URL.
    * Ensure lighthouse score is green targeting to 100 score on every page (taking into account previous considerations mentioned on this document)
