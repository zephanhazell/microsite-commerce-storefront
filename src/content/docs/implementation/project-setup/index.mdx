This section highlights the differences during the implementation phase compared to normal Edge Delivery projects.

## Project Kickoff

* Start project from Commerce boilerplate
  * Repository: [Edge Delivery + Commerce boilerplate](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce)
  * This is a fork of the normal Edge Delivery boilerplate which includes additional code for Commerce

* Setup content source
  * For document-based authoring with SharePoint or Google Docs only
  * Content is available as release artifact https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/releases

## Setup Commerce config

* In the starter content, you will find a configs.xlsx file in the root folder. This file is used to expose configuration parameters to the frontend blocks.
* Update the configuration values with the customer specific Catalog Service header values.
* Update the configuration values with the Core GraphQL endpoint that was configured as part of the CDN setup.
* The required values are documented on https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/references/configurations/.
