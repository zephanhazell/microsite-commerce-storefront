title: Discovery and preparation
description: Learn about Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services requirements, data validation, dropins, and Luma Bridge implementation.
---

Before starting any Edge Delivery + Commerce project, you must conduct a discovery phase to scope the project and ensure that there are no major roadblocks or risks.

The discovery phase is important because Adobe Commerce is a highly customizable platform with a large thid-party extension ecosystem. Migrating an Adobe Commerce storefront to Edge Delivery Services is similar to migrating to a headless storefront (like [PWA Studio](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio)).

:::note[Important]
The key requirement for a headless storefront implementation is that all required data is provided by APIs. Adobe Commerce provides all of the API coverage that you need for a successful implementation.

## Review Commerce requirements

Before starting the project, ensure that your Adobe Commerce backend meets the following requirements:

* **Product license**: Cloud or on-premises (Magento Open Source is not supported)
* **Version**: v2.4.7
* **PHP**: 8.3/8.2 for Adobe Commerce 2.4.7
* **Storefront services**: Ensure that the following services are installed and configured:
  * Data Connection service
  * Services Connector
  * Catalog Sync service
  * Catalog Service
  * Live Search
  * Product Recommendations

  See [Commerce requirements](/implementation/requirements/) for more information.

## Identify extensions

Before starting the project, use the following list to create an inventory of the Adobe Commerce extensions that are actively being used. This will help you understand which extensions can be replaced by out-of-the-box Adobe Commerce functionality.

* What extensions are currently in use?

* What type of data do the extensions prpvide (for example, reviews)?

* Is the data required on the frontend?
    
* How do the extensions expose the data (for example, GraphQL, REST API)?

* Do the extensions expose an API to access data (for example, [Amasty Labels](https://amasty.com/docs/doku.php?id=magento_2:product_labels))? If not, create an action item to expose the required data through an API. Options include:

  * Customize the Adobe Commerce Catalog Service exporter to export additional custom data to Catalog Service
  * Create a custom Adobe Commerce GraphQL query
  * Use [API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/).

* Are any of the extensions for delivery options (for example, shipping/BOPIS), payments, and tax providers? If you use third-party solutions, clarify if they expose APIs on the frontend and if they provide their own set of dropin components for the frontend integration.

## Validate option for dropins/widgets

Dropins are re-useable components that define the storefront shopping experience. They are framework agnostic and can be used in any context (Edge Delivery, AEM, Luma). However, this documentation focuses on the use of dropins in Edge Delivery Services projects using the [boilerplate template](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce). The dropin development roadmap is synchronised with Adobe Commerce APIs, so new API features are automatically available in dropins and widgets.

:::note
See the [dropins overview](/dropins/all/introduction/) for a list of all available dropins.

### Use cases and requirements

Document your use cases and requirements. If there are gaps, the Adobe team can help you understand how to fill them.

The Live Search Popover and PLP has two integration paths:

* Using the out-of-the-box hosted option where Adobe hosts the JavaScript file
  
    * Automatic updates for fixes and small features
    * Small upgrades available for major or breaking features
    * Can change some styling

* Using the customized option where Adobe provides a reference implementation for the components

    * Full control of customization and look and feel of sight
    * You host the library and own the total cost of ownership
